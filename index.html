<!-- Business Cases Section -->
<div id="business-cases" class="section">
    <h2>Business Cases Identified by Aditi Choudhary (01FE23BCS128)</h2>

    <h3>1. Waste management for industries</h3>
    <p>Chitranagari is a city located in Rajasthan which is facing problems in managing the industrial waste caused by its handicrafts and textile industries and also since it is located near the fields the disposal might be hazardous for crops. The improper disposal of waste might rise issues like pollution of water bodies and loss of yield in the fields. This needs a sustainable sensitive waste management system that helps in maintaining and preserving the clean environment for future generations.</p>

    <h3>2. Import and export of goods</h3>
    <p>Since the city Chitranagari is known for its cultural heritage and handicrafts, most of the people's livelihood depends on the import of raw materials and export of the goods. The main challenges are faced due to lack of networking and limited access to market data. We need a modern technology import-export system which has the capacity to support Chitranagari's people and make sure that they reach the global markets.</p>

    <h3>3. Improving living standards for farmers</h3>
    <p>The farmers of Chitranagari face significant challenges like both in livelihood and living conditions. Along with irregular rainfall and limited market access, many farmers live in inadequate housing with poor access to basic needs like clean water, electricity, etc. A complete solution is needed to improve both the living conditions and latest farming techniques, ensuring better livelihoods while preserving the economic sustainability.</p>

   <!-- Course Reflections Section -->
<div id="course-reflections" class="section">
    <h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>

    <h3>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</h3>
    <p>Nature provides numerous examples of problem-solving approaches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Tides rise and fall in a regular, repeated pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> A cauliflower looks identical at every level, from stem to tip.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Solving a maze by retracing steps when hitting a dead end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These natural patterns inspire solutions to similar problems in algorithm design.</p>

    <h3>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</h3>
    <p><strong>Time efficiency:</strong> Measures how fast an algorithm performs.</p>
    <p><strong>Space efficiency:</strong> Measures how much additional memory it requires.</p>
    <p>If an algorithm is slow or consumes excessive memory, it becomes impractical for large-scale problems.</p>

    <h4>Types of Growth in Algorithms:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Constant time (O(1)):</strong> Performance remains the same regardless of input size.</li>
        <li><strong>Logarithmic time (O(log n)):</strong> Slows slightly as input grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Linear time (O(n)):</strong> Performance slows proportionally with input size.</li>
        <li><strong>Linearithmic time (O(n log n)):</strong> Slower than linear, but manageable.</li>
        <li><strong>Quadratic time (O(n¬≤)):</strong> Becomes significantly slower with larger inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cubic time (O(n¬≥)):</strong> Even slower than quadratic.</li>
        <li><strong>Exponential (O(2‚Åø)) and Factorial (O(n!)):</strong> Infeasible for large inputs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. What are the takeaways from different design principles?</h3>
    <p>Effective problem-solving relies on various design principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break a problem into smaller parts, solve them individually, and combine results.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Store solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Choose the optimal solution at each step.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Explore all possibilities and revert incorrect decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These principles improve algorithm performance and simplify complex problems.</p>

    <h3>4. How do tree data structures solve problems?</h3>
    <p>Trees provide an organized way to store hierarchical data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> Efficient for searching sorted data but may become unbalanced.</li>
        <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST for optimal performance.</li>
        <li><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> Handles dynamic data effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A balanced tree with fewer rebalancing operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Heap:</strong> Quickly finds the largest or smallest value.</li>
        <li><strong>Trie:</strong> Ideal for searching words or prefixes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Why do we need array query algorithms?</h3>
    <p>Array query algorithms enhance efficiency in answering range-based questions (e.g., finding the sum or maximum).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefix Sums:</strong> Quickly calculate sums over any range.</li>
        <li><strong>Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees:</strong> Enable fast updates and queries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Applications include gaming, financial systems, and databases.</p>

    <h3>6. What is the difference between trees and graphs?</h3>
    <p><strong>Trees:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A strict hierarchy with no loops (e.g., family trees).</li>
        <li><strong>Traversals:</strong> Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder for hierarchical analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> File organization, decision-making systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Graphs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A collection of nodes and edges, allowing loops (e.g., road maps).</li>
        <li><strong>Traversals:</strong> Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for exploring networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Social networks, routing, and navigation systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. What about sorting and searching algorithms?</h3>
    <p><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Algorithms:</strong> Bubble Sort works well for small datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Algorithms:</strong> Quick Sort and Merge Sort are suitable for large datasets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Searching Algorithms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Search:</strong> Scans each element, slower but works with unsorted data.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Operates on sorted data for faster performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-life Applications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting algorithms rank search results or organize data.</li>
        <li>Searching algorithms locate contacts or find optimal paths in maps.</li>
    </ul>
