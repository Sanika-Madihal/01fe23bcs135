<!-- Business Cases Section -->
<div id="business-cases" class="section">
    <h2>Business Cases Identified by Sanika M Madihal (01FE23BCS135)</h2>

    <h3>1. Waste Management for Industries</h3>
    <p>Chitranagari is a city located in Rajasthan which is facing problems in managing the industrial waste caused by its handicrafts and textile industries and also since it is located near the fields the disposal might be hazardous for crops. The improper disposal of waste might rise issues like polltuion of water bodies and loss of yield in the fields. This needs a sustainable sensitive waste management system that helps in maintaining and preserving the clean environment for future generations.</p>

    <h3>2. Import and Export of Goods</h3>
    <p>Since the city Chitranagari is known for its cultural heritage and handicrafts, most of the people's livelyhood depends on the import of raw materials and export of the goods. The main challenges are faced due to lack of networking and limited acces to market data. We need a modern technology import-export system which has the capacity to support Chitranagari's people and make sure that they reach the global markets.</p>

    <h3>3. Improving Living Standards for Farmers</h3>
    <p>The farmers of Chitranagari face significant challenges like both in livelihood and living conditions. Along with irregular rainfall and limited market access, many farmers live in inadequate housing with poor access to basic needs like clean water, electricity, etc. A complete solution is needed to improve both the living conditionds and latest farming techniques, ensuring better livelihoods while preserving the economic sustainability.</p>

   <!-- Course Reflections Section -->
<div id="course-reflections" class="section">
    <h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>

    <h3>1. Iteration, Recursion and Bactracking</h3>
    <p>There are several kind of phenomena we see in the nature which describes or can be solved using the daa techniques like iteration, recursion and backtracking. For instance when it comes to iteration the rise and fall of the tidal waves is one of the best example to explain the iteration process where there is repeated pattern or regularity between each tide. Recursion is best described by the pattern of the cauliflower which shows the recursive pattern of the flower from stem to the tips. Whereas, backtracking is widely applicable in navigating the maze OR sudoku. We can use these natural problem solving techniques in daa to solve similar kind of problems in algorithmic world</p>
 
    <h3>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</h3>
    <p>Time efficiency is defined as the time taken by algorithm to execute or how long an algorithm takes to execute.</p>
    <p>Space efficiency is defined as the extra space taken by the algorithm.</p>
    <p>Importance of time and space efficiency is that when there is a large set of data and if the algorithm is inefficient it might not run properly or it may not give instant outputs(slow processing). The different class of problems are:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Constant time :</strong> The runtime remains the same regardless of the input size.Represented as O(1).</li>
        <li><strong>Logarithmic time :</strong> The runtime grows slowly, increasing logarithmically as the input size grows. Represented as O(logn).</li>
        <li><strong>Linear time :</strong> The runtime increases proportionally to the input size. Represented as O(n).</li>
        <li><strong>Linearithmic time :</strong> The runtime grows faster than linear but slower than quadratic. Represented as O(nlogn).</li>
        <li><strong>Quadratic time :</strong> The runtime grows quadratically. Represented as O(n^2)</li>
        <li><strong>Cubic time :</strong> The runtime increases even more steeply that quadratic. Represented as O(n^3).</li>
        <li><strong>Exponential time :</strong> The runtime grows exponentially, with each additional input. Represented as O(2^n).</li>
        <li><strong>Factorial time :</strong> The runtime grows extremely fast.Represented as O(n!).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. What are the takeaways from different design principles?</h3>
    <p>Effective problem-solving relies on various design principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break a problem into smaller parts, solve them individually, and combine results.</li>

        <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Choose the optimal solution at each step.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Explore all possibilities and revert incorrect decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These principles improve algorithm performance and simplify complex problems.</p>

    <h3>4. How do tree data structures solve problems?</h3>
    <p>Trees provide an organized way to store hierarchical data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> Efficient for searching sorted data but may become unbalanced.</li>
        <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST for optimal performance.</li>
        <li><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> Handles dynamic data effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A balanced tree with fewer rebalancing operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Heap:</strong> Quickly finds the largest or smallest value.</li>
        <li><strong>Trie:</strong> Ideal for searching words or prefixes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Why do we need array query algorithms?</h3>
    <p>Array query algorithms enhance efficiency in answering range-based questions (e.g., finding the sum or maximum).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefix Sums:</strong> Quickly calculate sums over any range.</li>
        <li><strong>Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees:</strong> Enable fast updates and queries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Applications include gaming, financial systems, and databases.</p>

    <h3>6. What is the difference between trees and graphs?</h3>
    <p><strong>Trees:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A strict hierarchy with no loops (e.g., family trees).</li>
        <li><strong>Traversals:</strong> Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder for hierarchical analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> File organization, decision-making systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Graphs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A collection of nodes and edges, allowing loops (e.g., road maps).</li>
        <li><strong>Traversals:</strong> Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for exploring networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Social networks, routing, and navigation systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. What about sorting and searching algorithms?</h3>
    <p><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Algorithms:</strong> Bubble Sort works well for small datasets.</li>

    <!-- Implementation Section -->
<div id="implementation" class="section">
    <h2>Implementation Section</h2>

    <h3>1. City Planning and Infrastructure (Graph & Shortest Path Algorithms)</h3>
    <p>To model the infrastructure and roads in the industrial zones, we can represent the city as a graph where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nodes represent locations (industrial zones, highways, factories, etc.).</li>
        <li>Edges represent roads and connections between locations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search to find the shortest path between industrial zones or between factories and supply chains. This can help in planning optimal transport routes.</li>
        <li>For traffic management, use Floyd-Warshall or Bellman-Ford to calculate shortest paths between all points, ensuring that transportation routes are well-optimized for various conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Industry Data Management (Hashing, Lookup Table, Binary Search Tree)</h3>
    <p>Each industrial zone could have a variety of data, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Company names</li>
        <li>Employee data</li>
        <li>Inventory data for products</li>
        <li>Resource allocation data</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use hashing for quick lookups of companies by their names or product IDs. For example, a hash table could store company details and provide constant time retrieval for any company.</li>
        <li>Use a lookup table to store fixed data, such as road names, area codes, and industrial zones.</li>
        <li>Use a binary search tree (BST) to manage a sorted list of companies or factories. This will make it easy to find the company with the most employees or the highest revenue.</li>
        <li>For more complex queries like searching for companies with specific product inventories or facilities, an AVL tree or Red-Black tree can help keep the data balanced, ensuring efficient searches and inserts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Resource Allocation (Priority Queue/Heap)</h3>
    <p>Resource management in industrial zones, such as prioritizing tasks (machine repairs, equipment supply), can be handled using a heap or priority queue.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a min-heap or max-heap to prioritize tasks based on urgency (e.g., factory maintenance, urgent deliveries). Tasks with the highest priority can be processed first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Dynamic Resource Allocation (Union-Find/Disjoint Set)</h3>
    <p>If multiple industrial zones are working together on large projects (e.g., shared infrastructure or resource pooling), a union-find data structure can be used to manage and merge these zones dynamically as they collaborate.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement Union-Find to track connected industrial zones or groups that are working together on projects (e.g., supply chain cooperation or shared resources like electricity or water).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Industrial Zone Growth (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Segment Tree)</h3>
    <p>As industrial zones expand, tracking their growth and managing infrastructure can become complex. A segment tree or AVL tree can help in managing resources across different zones, especially when performing range queries (e.g., total energy consumption in a set of zones).</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a segment tree to efficiently manage and query range-based data (e.g., energy consumption across several zones or road traffic over time).</li>
        <li>Alternatively, an AVL tree could be used to store and maintain a balanced record of industrial zones as they grow, making it easy to query and update the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Supply Chain Management (Queue/Deque)</h3>
    <p>Efficient supply chain management is critical for the industrial zones. A queue can represent the flow of materials and goods between factories.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a queue to manage the arrival of materials at factories, ensuring that they are processed in the correct order.</li>
        <li>For more complex, two-ended queues (e.g., loading and unloading materials at different points), a deque (double-ended queue) might be useful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Factory Performance Monitoring (Sparse Table, Fenwick Tree)</h3>
    <p>Monitoring the performance of various factories (e.g., production rates, employee efficiency, or machine performance) can be efficiently handled with data structures that support fast range queries.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fenwick Tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree) can be used for efficient cumulative frequency analysis, helping you track metrics such as total output, machine downtime, or employee hours over time.</li>
        <li>For static queries over large datasets (e.g., weekly production counts), a sparse table can be implemented to quickly retrieve data over a range without having to perform recalculations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Employee and Factory Management (List/Stack)</h3>
    <p>Factories may have dynamic operations that require managing shifts, employee roles, or equipment checks.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a list to manage employee data (e.g., shifts, roles, salaries) and update employee details dynamically.</li>
        <li>Use a stack for reversible tasks like equipment checklists (e.g., last-in, first-out task completion or rollback operations).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. Industrial Zone Optimization (Brute Force, Sorting Algorithms)</h3>
    <p>There may be need to optimize industrial zones in terms of factory placement, road layout, or equipment allocation.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Brute Force algorithms to test all combinations of zone layouts and equipment placements for efficiency, though this will be computationally expensive.</li>
        <li>Use sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort to sort zones or factories based on performance metrics (e.g., revenue, number of employees) to help identify the most efficient industrial zones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. Urban Traffic Management (BFS/DFS)</h3>
    <p>For managing traffic flow between industrial zones, Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) can be useful to find the most efficient path through the city's road network or find connected routes during peak traffic hours.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm Implementation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>BFS can be used to compute the shortest path for vehicles traveling between zones, taking into account different levels of traffic.</li>
        <li>DFS could be used to explore all possible routes from a starting industrial zone to its suppliers, ensuring redundancy in case of road closures or high traffic.</li>
    </ul>
