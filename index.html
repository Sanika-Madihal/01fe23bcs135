    <div id="business-cases" class="section">
        <h2>Business Cases Identified by Aditi Choudhary (01FE23BCS128)</h2>

        <h3>1. Waste Management for Industries üè¢</h3>
        <p>Chitranagari is a city located in Rajasthan that is facing challenges in managing the industrial waste caused by its handicrafts and textile industries. Additionally, the city's proximity to the fields adds further complexity to the situation.</p>

        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Proper waste management is essential for preventing environmental degradation and maintaining the health of the local population.</li>
            <li>With the growing industrial activities, the need for sustainable waste disposal solutions is critical to the city‚Äôs future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Chitranagari is committed to developing advanced waste management strategies, utilizing technology such as smart waste bins, efficient recycling processes, and sustainable disposal techniques. This initiative aims to reduce the ecological footprint of industrial waste while promoting a cleaner, healthier environment for residents and workers alike.</p>

        <h3>2. Import and Export of Goods üåç</h3>
        <p>Since the city Chitranagari is known for its cultural heritage and handicrafts, most of the people's livelihood depends on the import of raw materials and export of the goods. The main challenges are faced due to lack of networking and limited access to market data.</p>

        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A robust import-export system ensures sustainability for the city‚Äôs economic backbone: its people.</li>
            <li>Access to global markets will boost incomes and provide greater financial security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We need a modern technology-driven import-export system that has the capacity to support Chitranagari's people and make sure that they reach the global markets. This includes providing real-time market data, improving logistics, and establishing networks to strengthen the local economy.</p>

        <h3>3. Improving Living Standards for Farmers üåæ</h3>
        <p>The farmers of Chitranagari face significant challenges in both livelihood and living conditions. Along with irregular rainfall and limited market access, many farmers live in inadequate housing with poor access to basic needs like clean water, electricity, etc.</p>

        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Farmers form the backbone of Chitranagari's economy, and their prosperity is crucial for the city's growth.</li>
            <li>Improving living conditions will lead to better productivity and sustainability in agriculture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A complete solution is needed to improve both the living conditions and the adoption of the latest farming techniques, ensuring better livelihoods while preserving economic sustainability. By focusing on infrastructural improvements and training programs, Chitranagari can secure its future as a prosperous city.</p>

    <!-- Course Reflections Section -->
    <div id="course-reflections" class="section">
        <h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Iteration, Recursion and Backtracking</strong>
                <p>There are several natural phenomena that can be explained or solved using these techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> The rise and fall of tidal waves show repeated patterns, much like iterative processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> The pattern of a cauliflower illustrates recursion, with repeated structures from stem to tips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Useful for navigating mazes or solving Sudoku puzzles.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Time and Space Efficiency and Orders of Growth</strong>
                <p>Time efficiency is the execution time of an algorithm, while space efficiency refers to the additional memory required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>O(1): Constant time</li>
                    <li>O(log n): Logarithmic time</li>
                    <li>O(n): Linear time</li>
                    <li>O(n log n): Linearithmic time</li>
                    <li>O(n^2): Quadratic time</li>
                    <li>O(n^3): Cubic time</li>
                    <li>O(2^n): Exponential time</li>
                    <li>O(n!): Factorial time</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design Principles</strong>
                <p>Principles like partitioning and modularity enhance problem-solving efficiency by reducing time and space complexity.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tree Data Structures</strong>
                <p>Hierarchical structures based on parent-child relationships:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BST: For sorted data operations</li>
                    <li>AVL: Balanced BST</li>
                    <li>2-3 Tree: For dynamic datasets</li>
                    <li>Red-Black Tree: Efficient for dynamic datasets</li>

                    <li>Trie: For string operations based on prefixes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Array Query Algorithms</strong>
                <p>Efficiently operate on arrays using principles like divide and conquer or lazy propagation. Examples include Fenwick and Segment Trees.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Difference Between Tree and Graph</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trees are hierarchical and acyclic; traversal includes in-order, pre-order, post-order.</li>
                    <li>Graphs can have cycles; traversal uses BFS and DFS.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sorting and Searching</strong>
                <p>Techniques include Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and searching methods like BFS, KMP, and Rabin-Karp.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Spanning Tree and Shortest Path</strong>
                <p>Graph algorithms like Kruskal's and Dijkstra's are essential for applications like networking and navigation.</p>
